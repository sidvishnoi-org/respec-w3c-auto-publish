# ReSpec W3C Auto-Publish (GitHub Action)

GitHub action to [validate](https://github.com/marcoscaceres/respec-validator) a [ReSpec](https://github.com/w3c/respec/) document and publish it as a TR using [Echidna](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/).

The document is published only when a PR is merged. Validation is done when a PR is created/updated and merged.

## Inputs
Working Group Chairs and W3C Team members can [request a token](https://www.w3.org/Web/publications/register) directly from the W3C. This can then be saved as `ECHIDNA_TOKEN` in your repository settings under "Secrets". 

![secrets sections, in GitHub settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/870154/81380287-f9579f80-914d-11ea-84bc-5707bff75dba.png)

Please see [action.yml](action.yml)

## Example Usage

You need two things: 
 1. an "ECHIDNA" [manifest file](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki/Preparing-your-document#manifest-file)
 2. an action.yml file

### ECHIDNA manifest file
The [ECHINA manifest file](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki/Preparing-your-document#manifest-file) needs live at the root of your repository and make sure it's accessible via GitHub pages! 

Just change `your-spec-shortname` to whatever your spec's short name is. 

```
index.html?specStatus=WD&shortName=your-spec-shortname respec
```

### action.yml

Place this file in ".github/workflows/action.yml" (or some other filename if you'd like) and change things as appropriate for your spec.

``` yaml
name: Node CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - gh-pages
  pull_request: {}

jobs:
  validate-and-publish:
    name: Validate and Publish
